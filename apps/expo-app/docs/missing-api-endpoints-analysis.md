## Priority Breakdown

### üî¥ CRITICAL - Must Have (9 endpoints)
**Without these, core app functionality will not work:**

1. **Order Creation**: `POST /api/orders` - Users can't place orders
2. **Payment Processing**: `POST /api/payments/process` - Can't complete transactions
3. **Payment Intent**: `POST /api/payments/create-intent` - Stripe/Paystack integration
4. **Cart Operations**: 
   - `GET /api/cart` - View cart
   - `POST /api/cart` - Add to cart
   - `PUT /api/cart/{itemId}` - Update quantities
5. **Location**: `GET /api/merchants/nearby` - Can't find nearby merchants
6. **Messaging**: `POST /api/conversations/{id}/messages` - Can't send messages
7. **KYC Documents**: `POST /api/kyc/documents` - Merchants/Drivers can't verify

### üü† HIGH Priority (47 endpoints)
**Important for full user experience:**
- Authentication flows (OTP, password reset, social login)
- Order tracking and management
- Transaction history
- Notification management
- KYC verification process
- Communication features
- Admin user management

### üü° MEDIUM Priority (32 endpoints)

## Testing Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Test with authentication token** - Create a real user and test authenticated endpoints
2. **Verify commodities endpoint** - Fix or implement `/api/commodities`
3. **Test cart flow** - Critical for orders

### For Each Endpoint:
- [ ] Verify endpoint exists (returns non-404)
- [ ] Test with valid authentication
- [ ] Test request/response format
- [ ] Verify error handling
- [ ] Test role-based access (Consumer/Merchant/Driver/Admin)

---

## Quick Test Script

You can use this to quickly test all endpoints:

```bash
# Set your auth token
TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"

# Test critical endpoints
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.brillprime.com/api/cart
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.brillprime.com/api/orders
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.brillprime.com/api/merchants/nearby?lat=6.5244&lng=3.3792
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://api.brillprime.com/api/commodities
```

## Conclusion

**Total API Endpoints Expected**: 98  
**Currently Verified**: 8 (8%)  
**Need Implementation/Verification**: 90 (92%)

**Most Critical Missing**:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è `/api/commodities` - Confirmed 404
2. üîç Complete cart system (5 endpoints)
3. üîç Order creation flow (critical path)
4. üîç Payment processing (Stripe/Paystack)
5. üîç Location-based merchant discovery

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement/verify the 9 CRITICAL endpoints first
2. Test with real user authentication
3. Follow the 6-phase implementation plan
4. Build automated testing suite
