# Consumer Home Screen Implementation - Critical Path Testing

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Implement complete UI with MapContainer, markers, header, search, location setup, delivery tracking, sidebar, modals
- [x] Add all necessary components and styling
- [x] Create missing components: LocationSetupCard, Header, SearchBar, Sidebar, MerchantDetailsModal
- [x] Fix MapContainer import to use react-native-maps
- [x] Start Expo development server

## Critical Path Testing Tasks

### 1. App Launch and Basic Rendering
- [x] Start Expo development server
- [ ] Launch app in browser/simulator (Browser tool encountered protocol errors; manual testing recommended)
- [ ] Verify app loads without errors
- [ ] Check that map renders with blue styling

### 2. Location Setup Flow
- [ ] Test location permission request
- [ ] Verify automatic location setting works
- [ ] Check "Set Later" button functionality
- [ ] Confirm location setup card disappears after setting location

### 3. Map and Markers

### 4. Sidebar Navigation

- [ ] Verify search navigation works
- [ ] Check merchant details modal opens and displays info

## Next Steps After Critical Path
- Proceed to thorough testing of all edge cases and interactions
- Test error handling and loading states
- Verify responsive design and animations
- Resolve any remaining TypeScript errors (e.g., merchant route navigation)
- Manual testing recommended due to browser tool issues
